We are relatively ignorant of what our 'extended self' comprises or how it works. The human body is one of the most important ecological study sites of the coming decade. Humans depend on the microbial communities that colonize them for a surprising suite of benefits. These include: extracting energy from food, educating the immune system and protection from pathogens. Yet, despite the recent attention to this indigenous microbiota, we are relatively ignorant of what our 'extended self' comprises or how it works. 

The human body consists of multiple microbial habitats, studied and defined so far on the basis of gross anatomical features, such as the skin, mouth, intestines and vagina. 

Only a subset of the relevant habitats and habitat boundaries across the human landscape have been identified --- and important biology often takes place at such boundaries. 

Over the next ten years, molecular microbial surveys need to capture rare species and assess diversity at multiple spatial scales. Although the organization of the human microbiota is not random, little is known about the rules that govern its assembly. What are the contributions of early exposures, dispersal, and species interactions? Is there selection at the community level, and if so, how? And, most importantly, how does the human body control community composition? With answers to these questions, the assembly of the microbial community, for example on the tooth surface or intestinal mucosa, could be guided towards states that confer health. 

Equally pressing questions concern the stability and robustness of human microbial communities. How well do these communities resist perturbation by forces such as antibiotics, or return to their prior state after disturbance? How many healthy states are there? Does community resilience determine or predict human health? What mechanisms underlie resilience, and how can they be measured or reinforced? 

Answering these questions requires understanding the functional properties of the microbiota. This means coupling DNA sequencing with direct measurements of RNA, protein products, functional assays and associated environmental variables. 

The existing national and international projects to map the human microbiome are a good start. In addition this field needs well-controlled, longitudinal clinical studies; non-disruptive, minimally invasive sampling methods; management and analysis strategies for complex, multi-dimensional data; and new partnerships between microbiologists, ecologists, clinicians, physiologists and technologists.
