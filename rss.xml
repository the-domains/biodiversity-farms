            <description><![CDATA[<p>Stanford scientists produce cancer drug from rare plant in lab to benefit human health Stanford scientists produced a common cancer drug – previously only available from an endangered plant – in a common laboratory plant. This work could lead to a more stable supply of the drug and allow scientists to manipulate that drug to make it even safer and more effective.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are relatively ignorant of what our 'extended self' comprises or how it works. The human body is one of the most important ecological study sites of the coming decade. Humans depend on the microbial communities that colonize them for a surprising suite of benefits. These include: extracting energy from food, educating the immune system and protection from pathogens. Yet, despite the recent attention to this indigenous microbiota, we are relatively ignorant of what our 'extended self' comprises or how it works. </p>]]></description>
